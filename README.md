   - Windows: Inside the `dl` folder located in the same directory as 3DObjectViewer.exe.

# Trouble Shooting
After recording a video with depth on iPhone, if the video does not appear immediately in LookingGlass, please remove DepthVideoPlayer.exe from your firewall settings once.  
Alternatively, turn off the firewall only when using this application.
